Agile Model

1. Agile is a incremental and iterative model

The main basic principles of agile

if the project has 100 features to develop we dont do it in a single shot
and dont make the customer to wait for a long time ,so we release the few number features to customers as early as possible
 we can accomodate the new functionalities even in middle of the project 

 IN agile there will be good communication between a developer,qa , business analyst , testers and customers and work for a common goal 

 1. requirement understanding
 2. design 
 3. coding
 4. testing 
 we will be done regularly 

 Requirements are allowed at any point of time or development
 releases will be faster 
 It is very easy to  adopt

 Disadvantages:
   1. less focus on the documentation and design as releases are very fast


Agile is the defined process with some  priciples
To Achieve this we need a Frame work to follow this principles ,that framework is called  Scrum
Simply Agile says what principles need to follow and Scrum says how to follow 

what is Scrum?
Scrum is framework which help us to develop and test in the agile model

Scrum is a framework through which we build product vy following Agile Principles 

People those are involved in this process are called scrum or agile team , this team normally contain 5-9 members 

People who are involved in Scrum team are
  1. product owner: 
       He is the first point of contact to the customer
       Define the features of the Product 
       Prioritize features according to market value
       Adjust features and priority every iteration as needed
       Accept or reject work results
       He gather the requirements and features from the customer and allocates it to the developers

  2. Scrum master:
       The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process  
       most of the meetings are organised by the Scrum master
  3. Dev team
  4. QA team
       Developer will develop the software and Qa team will test the software


Scrum Terminology : 
   * User story: A Feature/module in a software these are smaller requirements
   * Epic: Collection of User stories these are larger requirements 
   * Product backlog: Contains list of user stories .Prepared by Product owner
   * Sprint/iteration : Period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner and team , usually 2-4 weeks of time.
   
   * Sprint planning meeting: meeting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and duration
   * Sprint backlog: List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint , we can simply say this is the subset of the product backlog
   * Scrum meeting: meeting conducted by scrum master every day for 15 min , called as Standup meeting/scrum call
      Scrum master will track all the updates in the agile process. This meeting about to discuss about the completed tasks and tasks planned for today and tasks planned for tomorrow .
      If any team member is facing any difficulties or facing any blockholes this is the right spot to discuss and solve the problems

   * Sprint retrospective meeting: This meeting will be condcuted once after the completion of the sprint, in this meeting everyone will participate and discuss about the things what went wrong , what need to be improved and what went as planned .what are the plans for the next sprint to keep up to the mark

   * Story point: Rough estimation of User stories , will be given by Dev and QA in the form of fibonacci series 
    Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 ...........
    1 story point = some companies will consider as 1 hour / 1 day(6 hours)

    Login story ---------> Dev- 5 hrs QA -3 = 8hrs / 1 day

    * Burndown Chart: shows how much work remaining in the sprint,
                      Maintained by the Scrum master Daily 

These are categorised in to 3 different types:
      1. Roles: 
          * Product Owner
          * Scrum Master
          * Team 
      2. Artifacts :
          * product backlog 
          * sprint backlog and Burndown Chart
      3. Ceremonies:
          * Sprint planning
          * Daily Scrum
          * Sprint review

Scrum Board:
    The main topics in the scrum board or diferent process are:
            1. Stories
            2. to do
            3. in progress
            4. Testing
            5. Done

All the things above can be tracked by the agile management tool 
example of that is jira
