In python everything is a object
corresponding class name can be determined by 
``` type()```

class : is the blue print to create objects
object: it is the physical existence of the class

objects has properties/attributes/state
objects will have behaviour/methods

class contains both variables and methods

* class names should starts with upper-case letters
# self is a reference variable pointing to the current object , it is not mandatory to use self as the instance variable any thing which is passed as the first variable to the constructor is taken as the instance variable

* reference variable 


# constructor is a special method 
     1. name of this is always fixed (def __init__())
     2.constructor is executed whenever the object is created 
     inside the constructor we are defining and initialising the object related  variable
     3.this will be executed once per object 
     4.constructor should take at least one argument
     5.constructor is optional if we not provide the python will provide one default constructor 
     6. we can call this constructor explicitly 

## Difference between method and constructor


Types of variables
* instance variab(object level)
* static variables(class level)
*local variable (method  variables )
